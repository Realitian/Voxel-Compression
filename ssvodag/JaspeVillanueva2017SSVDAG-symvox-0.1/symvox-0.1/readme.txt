
====================================================
	SymVox v0.1 (Symmetry Voxelator) Software
	(c)2016	ViC / CRS4	http://vic.crs4.it  
====================================================
	
:: Introduction
----------------
	This software is intended to show the techniques described on the papers
	on SSVDAGs (Symmetry-aware Sparse Voxel DAGs) by Visual Computing
	Group (CRS4 - Italy). It provides two tools:
		
		- svbuilder: to construct Sparse Voxel DAGs, with and without
		symmetries or encoding, as described in the paper.
		
		- svviewer: an OpenGL viewer for the encoded octrees, with an
		GLSL based traversal.
							
:: Requirments
----------------
	CMake for construction, C++ compiler, OpenMP for parallelization.
	The compilation and use as been tested in Windows (7, 8.1 and 10)
	and Linux (Ubuntu, ArchLinux) platforms, with Visual Studio
	(2013 and 2015) and GCC 4.2+.

:: Dependencies
------------------
	SpaceLand (SL): set of C++ classes for geometric computations.
	http://vic.crs4.it/vic/download/
	
	For building the OpenGL viewer, the following libraries are also required:
		
		GLFW: cross-platform OpenGL context management
		http://www.glfw.org/
		
		GLEW: OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library
		http://glew.sourceforge.net/

:: Build Instructions
---------------------
	The building is based on CMake tool. It will detect the
	required libraries and produce the platform target files
	for compiling.
	
	mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make
	
	The binaries will be produced in a "bin" folder. It is recommended
	to launch the viewer from this folder, as it will search for the
	required shader "octree_dda.glsl.frag" in the path "../shaders".
	
	Usage and examples will be shown when launching
	the built tools without parameters.
